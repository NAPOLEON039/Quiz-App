# Quiz App

This project is part of the Vue course on Udemy by [Maximilian SchwarzmÃ¼ller](https://twitter.com/maxedapps). The course takes you from a beginner in Vue to at least an intermediate Vue developer. You will learn a lot from this course and Max teaches the concepts in a really great way. There are some quizzes and challenges at the start to make sure you have grasped the concepts. The later stages will have less of these challenges and more projects.

This is one of the short projects that is a part of the course. It was actually taught to demonstrate how transition is applied to a dynamic component. But I felt this could become a separate project on its own.

If you like this simple project and would like to make more such projects or wish to take your Vue skills to a whole new level, check out [this course](https://www.udemy.com/vuejs-2-the-complete-guide) on Udemy.

For a detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
